# CharacterID

1) Get a character from the user using character input. After you read the character in, print the character out and print a linebreak so the output is not jumbled together. Also see #9.

2) Determine if the character is a capital letter,  lower case letter,  number, or  other character.

3) Print the string Capital, Lower, Number, or Other to the screen according to the type of character on the next line.

4) If the user entered any type of vowel, print Vowel on the next line on the next line.

5) If the user entered an even number, print Even on the next line. Similarly, if the user entered an odd number, print Odd on the next line.

6) Continue to prompt the user until the character 'q' or 'Q' is read in. If 'q' or 'Q' is read in, the program ends. Do not have the program determine the type of character. Printing the q/Q is optional.
